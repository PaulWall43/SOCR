Settlers of Catan Randomiser.

This was a simple project in bash to practice scripting and to a Settlers of Catan board randomizer.
Up to this point I had never written in a scripting language before or written a "script" per se, so I 
was interested in trying to actually write a useful script that solves a problem. 

It's often a problem that the order of the pieces on the Settlers of Catan board are affected by the order they
were inserted into the box and in turn that order was affected by the previous game's setup. So in order to 
solve this problem of similar board arrangments I wanted to create this script to help with getting a more 
random board.

I used bash as my scripting language as a way to get more familiar with reading input and a simple way and how 
the old scripting language of bash actually worked.I use this script whenever I play Settlers of Catan.
